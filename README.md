# Salt Lake City Food Inspection Visualization (SLCFVIS) - Process Book

### Background and Motivation.
We will be creating an interactive visualization of food inspection data from the Salt Lake County Health Department. This visualization will be helpful as it informs possible restaurant patrons about the overall cleanliness of whatever establishments they may be seeking to dine at. 
We have also found the information in these data humorous, in a sardonic way. For example, we saw a sushi burrito restaurant that received over 70 health code violations in the past four years. 
Additionally, one of our group members is particularly interested in urban geography, and this project has an urban geological component from the spatial context of the establishment locations. 
Furthermore, we determined that this dataset was accessible to us because the Salt Lake City Health Department provides thorough definitions for the attributes of these data.
